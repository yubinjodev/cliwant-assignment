# üé® Design Pattern

## Component Organization

- Structured the application using functional components
- Focused on keeping components modular and reusable where necessary

## State Management

- Used React‚Äôs useState for simple local states
- Utilized Zustand for complex states that needed to be shared across components

## Data Flow & Props Management

- Followed React‚Äôs unidirectional data flow principle
- Used props to pass data between components while avoiding excessive prop drilling
